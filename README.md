# Movie Finder

## Description
The user is able to search for their favorite movie titles/genres. Once their desired title is found, they can then add the title into their "Favorites" list or their "Watch Later" list. 

## Installation
For this project the user must install node.js as well as the following:
1. Sequelize
2. Bcrypt
3. Handlebars.js
4. Express.js
5. Dotenv

## Usage
To use this generator, the user must install all necessary packages using "npm install". Then they must type "node server.js" into the terminal until the console log reads 'Now listening on PORT 3001'. After that message shows in the terminal, the user can then load "localhost 3001" into their browser to use the application. The following video shows the details of this app.
